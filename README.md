Amazon_Data_Analysis
First i was working on Walmart project but it was not running properly on VS code because of the the library's and then i tried to do it on colab but got to know that scraping Walmart it's self is tough and not getting the output. So i changed the topic from Walmart to Amazon and scraped it. The output consists of products in the file.
